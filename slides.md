## What is Csound?
Csound is an open source sound and music computing system originally developed in 1985 at MIT.

It is an audio coding language that can generate and modify sound.

**It was originally written in the "C" language**

and it now uses C++, too.

It has APIs for C and C++, and API bindings for Python, Java, and Lua.

**Csound is small and highly portable.**

It runs on all major operating systems, iOS, Android and embedded systems like Raspberry PI and COSMO:

It also compiles to WASM and runs in the browser.

## How is Csound used?

The old-school way is to write a text file that Csound understands, save it, and run the **`csound`** command with it in a CLI terminal.

There are also "frontends" that are GUIs for editing and running Csound files:

[CsoundQt](https://csoundqt.github.io/),
and [Blue](https://blue.kunstmusik.com/)

[Cabbage](https://cabbageaudio.com/) is my favorite because it can create plugins for audio apps like LMMS, Reaper, Logic, ProTools, Ableton Live, etc ...

There are also Emacs modes:<br>
[Csound-x](http://www.zogotounga.net/comp/csoundx.html)
and [csound-mode](https://github.com/hlolli/csound-mode)
<br>
<br>
a [VIM plugin](https://github.com/luisjure/csound-vim)
